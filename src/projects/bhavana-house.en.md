Bhavana House is located on a plot of 6 rai in Wang Nam Khiao district, Nakhon
Ratchasima Province. It is an area that my parents liked and intend to live here
after retirement. Here there will be projects to expand into more than 10 villas
in the future.

I was in charge of the design concept and construction of the Master Plan and
the first house, and consultant in the design process of the next houses -
especially for my parents who want to Provence style houses and take care of
the garden and landscape around.

The First house is divided into two sections, one that looks like a pavilion and
the other section for prayer. Initially, this area was a sloping hill, so the hill
was added to support the weight of the house. The building was designed to
look like floating off the ground all the time. One side floats above the water
surface of the excavated lotus pond, and the other side protruding from the
mound. The interior design and decoration in the living room gives you a great
view from the inside, a view that makes me feel like I&#39;m living in a house
floating in the sky.

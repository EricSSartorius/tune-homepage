The residential architecture of Atherton, California, is nothing if not eclectic. Although about half of the 5,900 square feet behind the curving enclosure are sheltered under flat roofs, the architect has dubbed the residence the Roofless House, since the remaining space is devoted to courtyards and is open to the sky.

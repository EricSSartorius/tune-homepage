Bite Me Softly is a cafe for snacks, tea and food in Tor Kai Chae Road by Chao, Tawjan Boonyasingha, a young woman who loves to cook as well as eating. Chao has long been a person who likes to cook and sell snacks under the name of Bite Me Softly since before there was no storefront. From her long baking experience and her crafting recipes that are adapted to the Thai palate, I wanted to build a cafe that embraces everything and is in an area that she can manage by herself. Bite Me Softly now has a small cafe in the same fence as the house, but the building is separated from her house by a landscape contour.

The building has an area of ​​25 square meters and has two old trees already in the fence of the house, so I used these two trees to determine the shape of the building and try to allocate the available space to the maximum benefit. The concept of this restaurant is to make a 'Café Around The Tree', a cafe surrounded by big trees. A warm white color and clear floated glass is used to make the building look bright and broad.

When entering the store, it will not feel cramped. If you look outside the shop, you will see a garden and large trees to hide the privacy of the house next to it. After several experiments with various lighting designs, I decided to orient lighting upwards for a softer, more comfortable light than directly from the ceiling.

# Khao

Ekkamai Bangkok

The project of Khao started after the owner and Chef Vichit Mukura, one of the most well-known Thai Chefs, decided to expand the original 10 seat Chef's Table in Sukhumvit 51. The architecture is inspired by Mid-century Modernism and the construction of local rice houses in Thailand.

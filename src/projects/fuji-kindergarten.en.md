Fuji Kindergarten, a big tree school that wants children to enjoy learning
in the middle of nature.

Best learning in kindergarten Is learning by playing. Fuji Kindergarten
was designed to encourage children to play more efficiently and create
learning experiences that are open to children.

Fuji Kindergarten It was designed by Japanese architect Takaharu
Tezuka, owner of architect firm TEZUKA, a company that I had the
opportunity to work with while on a journey to gain more experience in
Japan after graduation. I was involved in the conceptual design of Ring
Around The Tree, a circular building that surrounds a big tree.

Fuji Kindergarten is a school that places great emphasis on children's
play. The school's buildings and environment are spherical. Tezuka
observed the playing behavior of the children and found that nature of
children is to often run in a circle. The shape of the building and the track
is therefore designed in a circular motion to match the direction of the
child's running.

‘Ring Around The Tree’ is a circular building with a total of 7 floors, but
only 5 meters high, because all the scales such as sinks, ceilings, steps,
etc. are designed to fit the child's body. The circular building is designed
to allow you to run and play safely on the school building. More
importantly, the building structure is still a structure that has no clear
boundaries. There is no block between the natural classroom and the
play area to open up their imagination in both learning and playing.
Climbing, hanging, hanging or falling down and wounds from running are
part of helping children learn and grow.

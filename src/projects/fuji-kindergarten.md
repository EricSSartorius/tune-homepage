Fuji Kindergarten is selected as one of the first ten Global Innovations by the Finland-based educational organization, HundrED.cts
The space created by Tezuka seems to have just two floors, but for the children the building has six floors with volumes that are one meter high. The compressed spaces, which can only be reached by crawling, further the freedom of movement and ability to use the body as a means of learning.

At the Fuji Kindergarten, "Ring Around a Tree" by Tezuka Architects promotes freedom of movement as a tool for learning.
